description: >
   This is an operational report for the PEC. The report identifies any in preparation or
   pending review grants in the database. The purpose of the report is to provide the PEC
   with a mechanism to follow-up with investigators regarding the status of previously reported
   in prep/pending grants. It is often the case that this status is not always updated as it
   must be investigator-provided.
