Description: As part of a NCI-funded U54 grant, this package offers R Markdown templates
 for reporting on grant activities. This is part of a larger ecosystem consisting of REDCap
 annotation of grants and publications that can then be reporting on through these templates.
 Note that much of the functionality behind these templates exists in the library pgreportr
 (program grant report library). This library holds the markdown templates for nice MS-Word
 based reports (and Excel raw data dumps).
